# Wind Energy Prediction

➡️ Wind energy production prediction

🔻 Motivation

🔸 The project addresses the integration of non-operable renewable energy sources, such as wind energy, into advanced electricity grids. These energy sources, unlike traditional energy sources such as gas or oil, cannot be directly controlled by operators as they are dependent on weather conditions. Accurate forecasting of energy production is therefore essential. Traditional weather forecasting models, such as the Global Forecast System (GFS, USA) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), provide detailed weather forecasts, but translating them into accurate energy production figures is complex.

🔸 To close this gap, the project employs machine learning models using ECMWF weather data to predict energy production at the Sotavento experimental wind farm in Spain. The model processes 22 different meteorological variables, including both direct indicators of wind energy potential and other less apparent factors. The project uses a 5x5 grid around Sotavento, analysing each variable at 25 different locations to create a complete dataset of 550 attributes.
